    "Definition": [
        "In this task, we ask you to write an answer to a question that involves events that may be stationary (not changing over time) or transient (changing over time). For example, the sentence \"he was born in the U.S.\" contains a stationary event since it will last forever; however, \"he is hungry\" contains a transient event since it will remain true for a short period of time. Note that a lot of the questions could have more than one correct answer. We only need a single most-likely answer. Please try to keep your \"answer\" as simple as possible. Concise and simple \"answer\" is preferred over those complex and verbose ones."
